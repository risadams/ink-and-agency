# GraphQL

Offensive methodology for attacking GraphQL APIs during penetration tests and bug bounty engagements. Covers the full attack lifecycle: endpoint discovery, introspection abuse and blind schema reconstruction when introspection is disabled, authentication and authorization bypass through Relay node IDs and nested object traversal, injection via variables and directives, query batching for brute force and OTP bypass, denial of service through depth bombs and alias amplification, WebSocket subscription hijacking, information disclosure through verbose errors and field suggestion oracles, and file upload abuse via the multipart GraphQL specification. Includes tool-specific guidance for InQL, graphql-cop, CrackQL, BatchQL, Altair, GraphQL Voyager, and clairvoyance. Trigger on: GraphQL, graphql, introspection query, batching attack, query depth, GraphQL injection, GraphQL IDOR, field suggestion, GraphQL auth bypass, GraphQL DoS, GraphQL security, graphql-cop, InQL, CrackQL, BatchQL, Relay node, alias amplification, subscription abuse, multipart upload GraphQL, schema enumeration, __schema, __type. Use when performing authorized red-team, pentest, or research work involving graphql.
