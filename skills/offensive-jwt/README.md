# JWT

JWT attack methodology for penetration testers. Covers algorithm confusion (alg:none, RS256→HS256), weak HMAC secret brute force, kid parameter injection (SQLi, path traversal), jku/x5u/jwk header injection, JWKS cache poisoning, JWS/JWE confusion, timing attacks, and mobile JWT storage extraction. Use when testing JWT-based authentication, hunting auth bypass via token manipulation, or evaluating JWT implementation security in web or mobile apps.

## When to use

Use when testing JWT-based authentication, hunting auth bypass via token manipulation, or evaluating JWT implementation security in web or mobile apps.
