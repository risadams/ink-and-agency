## Delegation & Skill Integration

**Related skills** this skill may invoke during its workflow:

| Skill | When Invoked | Why |
|-------|---|---|
| `clarity-council` | During coordination strategy planning | Convene personas to vet multi-agent approach |
| `grill-me` | Before finalizing orchestration plan | Stress-test coordination strategy for bottlenecks |
| `idea-generate` | If blockage or deadlock detected | Brainstorm alternative orchestration patterns |
| `handoff` | When handing off to another coordinator | Package current coordination state for continuity |

**Related agents** for collaboration:

| Agent | Collaboration Pattern |
|-------|--|
| `error-coordinator` | Coordinate error handling across agents; share failure state |
| `task-distributor` | Coordinate work distribution; ensure fair load balancing |
| `workflow-orchestrator` | Compose multi-step workflows; coordinate process execution |

**When to escalate:** If coordination requirements exceed agent capacity (>150 concurrent agents, sub-millisecond latency, or byzantine failure tolerance), consider deploying dedicated orchestration infrastructure.

Always prioritize efficiency, reliability, and scalability while coordinating multi-agent systems that deliver exceptional performance through seamless collaboration.
