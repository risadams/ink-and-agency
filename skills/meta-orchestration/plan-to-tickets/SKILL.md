# Plan to Tickets

Break a spec, plan, or conversation into **tasks** — **tracer-bullet** vertical slices, each declaring the tasks that **block** it — and stage them as a **local, numbered task list** (spec-kit style). Jira is an opt-in downstream target, never the default.

**Local-first.** Tasks are written to a local `tasks.md` you control. Nothing is created in Jira (or any remote) without the user explicitly asking, and never without confirming first. The local `tasks.md` is the source of truth; Jira tickets are a downstream projection of it.

## Process

### 1. Resolve the staging location

Tasks live beside their spec, spec-kit style:

```text
<staging>/NNN-<feature-slug>/spec.md      (from /plan-to-spec, if any)
<staging>/NNN-<feature-slug>/tasks.md     (this skill writes here)
```

Resolve `<staging>` in this order:

1. If the source is a `/plan-to-spec` folder, write `tasks.md` beside its `spec.md`.
2. A path the user passed as an argument this run.
3. The memory default `reference_plan_staging_dir.md`, if it exists.
4. Otherwise **ask** where to stage (offer `./specs/` or `.plans/`). Offer to record the answer to `reference_plan_staging_dir.md` — only with consent.

State the resolved path before writing.

### 2. Gather context

Work from the conversation. If the user passes a reference (a staged `spec.md`, a Confluence URL, a Jira key), fetch its full body and read it.

### 3. Explore the codebase (optional)

If you haven't already, explore to understand the current code. Task titles use the project's domain vocabulary and respect ADRs in the area. Look for **prefactoring** — "make the change easy, then make the easy change."

### 4. Draft vertical slices

Break the work into **tracer-bullet** tasks:

- Each slice cuts a narrow but **complete** path through every layer (schema, API, UI, tests) — vertical, not a horizontal slice of one layer.
- A completed slice is demoable or verifiable on its own.
- Each slice fits in a single fresh context window.
- Prefactoring goes first.

Give each task its **blocking edges** — the tasks that must finish before it can start. A task with no blockers can start immediately, and independent tasks are marked `[P]` (parallelizable).

**Wide refactors are the exception.** A **wide refactor** — one mechanical change (rename a column, retype a shared symbol) whose **blast radius** fans across the codebase — can't land green as a single vertical slice. Sequence it **expand–contract**: *expand* (add the new form beside the old, nothing breaks), *migrate* the call sites in batches sized by blast radius (per package/dir), each batch a task blocked by the expand and green because the old form still exists, then *contract* (delete the old form) in a task blocked by every migrate batch.

### 5. Quiz the user

Present the breakdown as a numbered list. Per task: **ID + Title**, **Blocked by**, **What it delivers** (the end-to-end behaviour). Ask:

- Does the granularity feel right (too coarse / too fine)?
- Are the blocking edges correct — does each task depend only on tasks that genuinely gate it?
- Should any be merged or split?

Iterate until approved. **Do not write anything before approval.**

### 6. Write the local task list

Write the approved tasks to `<staging>/NNN-<feature-slug>/tasks.md` using the template below. Tasks are numbered `T001`, `T002`, … in dependency order (blockers first). This is where the skill **stops by default** — the tasks are staged, ready for `/implement` to work one at a time.

<tasks-template>

# <Feature name> — Tasks

Spec: [spec.md](spec.md)  ·  Source: <spec / plan / conversation>

Legend: `[P]` = parallelizable (no incomplete blockers). Work the **frontier** — any unchecked task whose blockers are all done.

## Tasks

- [ ] **T001** — <title>  ·  Blocked by: none `[P]`
  - What it delivers: <end-to-end behaviour, user's perspective>
  - Acceptance:
    - [ ] Criterion 1
    - [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] **T002** — <title>  ·  Blocked by: T001
  - What it delivers: …
  - Acceptance:
    - [ ] Criterion 1

## Jira mapping

<!-- filled in only if pushed to Jira (step 7): T001 -> PRJ-1490, ... -->

</tasks-template>

Avoid file paths and code snippets — they go stale. Exception: a prototype snippet encoding a decision more precisely than prose (state machine, reducer, schema, type shape) — inline the decision-rich parts, note it came from a prototype.

### 7. Push to Jira — only if asked

If — and only if — the user asks to push, confirm the destination first (read the project key from `reference_jira_default_project.md`; confirm project + issue type), then create one issue per task in **dependency order** (blockers first) so blocking edges reference real keys:

1. `jira_create_issue` — `summary` = task title, `description` = the task's What-it-delivers + acceptance criteria.
2. After both endpoints of an edge exist, wire it with `jira_link_issues` using the **"Blocks"** link type (blocker = inward, blocked = outward). Confirm the exact link-type name once via `jira_get_issue_link_types` — it varies per instance.
3. If the source was a Jira ticket, link each new issue to it as the parent (don't modify the parent).

Write the `T00N -> KEY` mapping back into the local `tasks.md` **Jira mapping** section so local and remote stay reconciled. Report the created keys and the frontier.

## Rules

- **Local-first, always.** The numbered `tasks.md` is written before any remote call and remains the source of truth.
- **No Jira writes without an explicit ask AND a confirmed destination.** Never create tickets by default; confirm project + issue type first.
- **Staging location is the user's to choose.** Beside the spec > argument > memory default > ask. Persist the default only with consent.
- **Nothing written before approval.** The breakdown is quizzed and iterated first; the `tasks.md` write happens only after sign-off.
- **Blockers first, native links.** When pushing to Jira, create in dependency order and use the "Blocks" relationship (renders the frontier in Jira's UI), not just prose.
- **Never modify the parent.** Link to it; don't transition or close it.
