# Wait, What

Wait — I don't understand where you've got to here. Re-pitch **that**.

Not "that last message": what lost me is usually bigger than one paragraph, so decide for yourself how far back to go and start from wherever the thread actually broke.

- Give me a little bit of context first: what problem you were solving and where in the work you are.
- Talk in ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English — short sentences, one idea each, plain words.
- Use the ubiquitous language from `CONTEXT.md` for domain terms, and spell out any term that isn't in it.
- Add the premise I was missing. Comprehension failed here — deleting words without supplying that premise makes it shorter and no clearer.
- Don't apologise, don't re-run the work, and don't reach a new conclusion.
