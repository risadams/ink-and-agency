# Overwhelm Triage

Everything is competing for the same slot and none of it is moving. The user does not need a prioritized list — a prioritized list is eleven decisions wearing a trench coat. They need **one thing**, and explicit permission to not think about the other ten.

## Let them dump first

Do not ask clarifying questions before the dump. If they have already dumped, work with that. If they have only said "I'm overwhelmed," ask once:

> **Dump everything that's taking up space. Unsorted, unpunctuated, no order. Include the things that aren't tasks.**

Getting it out of working memory is half the value of this skill. Do not interrupt it.

## Externalize it

Mirror the dump back as a numbered list, verbatim in meaning, one item per line. No commentary yet.

Pull anything that is **not a task** into a separate short block first:

> **Not tasks (these are worries, and they were taking up task slots):**
> - The thing about whether the review went badly

A worry parked as a worry stops competing with work. If one belongs to [`rejection-sensitivity-check`](../rejection-sensitivity-check/) or [`meeting-decompression`](../meeting-decompression/), say so in one line and move on.

## Sort into four buckets

Show counts, not full re-listings, for everything except **Today**.

- **Today** — a real consequence lands today if it doesn't happen. List these in full.
- **This week** — a real deadline, just not today. Count only.
- **No date** — it feels urgent and has no deadline. Count only. Most of the list lands here, and saying so out loud is the point.
- **Not yours** — someone else owns it, it's already dead, or it resolves itself. Count, plus one line each on why it's off the list.

Be strict about **Today**. "It would be good to" is not a consequence. If the user pushes back on a placement, move it and continue — do not debate.

## Pick one

From **Today**, pick by **highest consequence if missed**, tie-broken by **smallest**. Not by importance — importance is the axis that jammed.

If **Today** is empty, pick the smallest item from **This week** and say plainly that nothing is actually due today.

## Output

Five lines, no more:

> **Do this: [the one thing].**
> First action: [one literal ≤2-minute step].
> Because: [the consequence that lands today].
> **Parked until [when]:** [N] this week, [N] no-date, [N] not yours.
> Everything on that parked list is allowed to not happen today.

Then stop. Do not restate the buckets. Do not offer a schedule.

## Route out

- **Three or more real Today items** — this is a capacity problem, not a triage problem. Say so and hand to [`energy-budget`](../energy-budget/) via `Skill`.
- **User can't start the one thing** — hand to [`task-initiation`](../task-initiation/) via `Skill`.
- **An item is a hyperfixation, not an obligation** — hand to [`interest-capture`](../interest-capture/) so it gets stored instead of argued with.

## Why no council

The user is drowning in options. Adding personas adds options. Run inline, always fast.

## What NOT to do

- Do not return a ranked list of everything — that is the failure this skill exists to prevent.
- Do not ask which one *feels* most important. If they could answer that, they would not be here.
- Do not say "just break it down" — a breakdown of eleven things is still eleven things.
- Do not add anything to the list, however obviously missing.
- Do not reassure, reframe, or point out that it's not as bad as it seems.
