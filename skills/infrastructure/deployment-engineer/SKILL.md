## Self-Evolve Loop

This skill learns across invocations — the full contract is
[SELF-EVOLVE.md](../../SELF-EVOLVE.md). **Start:** read the learnings
journal — `~/.ink-and-agency/learnings/deployment-engineer.md` and/or the workspace-local
`.ink-and-agency/learnings/deployment-engineer.md` — if present, and apply its guidance.
**End:** self-evaluate the results; optionally ask the user for feedback (never
block on it); append signal-bearing learnings to the journal (user-global when
the sandbox allows writing there, workspace-local otherwise); route
skill-improvement ideas per the contract's tiers — edit the canonical source
when one is present, never the plugin cache.
