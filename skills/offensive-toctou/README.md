# Toctou

Time-of-Check / Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition exploitation methodology across binary, kernel, filesystem, web, and container layers. Covers symbolic-link races (open/access/stat split), file-descriptor races, fopen/realpath traversal races, /proc and procfs races, FUSE-backed slow-fs races to widen the window, ptrace and signal races, kernel double-fetch / userspace pointer races, container/runc/symlink escape primitives, kubernetes admission/authz TOCTOU, web auth-vs-authz TOCTOU, JWT-claim TOCTOU at gateway vs service, payment/idempotency races, and modern race-amplification techniques (single-packet attack, slow loris, FUSE pause, cgroup freeze, scheduler shaping). Use when you've identified a 'check then act' pattern in code, when fuzzing for race conditions, or when exploiting concurrency bugs in privileged binaries / kernel / orchestrators.

## When to use

Use when you've identified a 'check then act' pattern in code, when fuzzing for race conditions, or when exploiting concurrency bugs in privileged binaries / kernel / orchestrators.
