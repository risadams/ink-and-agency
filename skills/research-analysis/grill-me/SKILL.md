Interview me relentlessly about every aspect of this plan until we reach a shared understanding. Walk down each branch of the design tree, resolving dependencies between decisions one-by-one. For each question, provide your recommended answer.

Ask the questions one at a time.

If a question can be answered by exploring the codebase, explore the codebase instead.

## Self-Evolve Loop

This skill learns across invocations — the full contract is
[SELF-EVOLVE.md](../../SELF-EVOLVE.md). **Start:** read the learnings
journal — `~/.ink-and-agency/learnings/grill-me.md` and/or the workspace-local
`.ink-and-agency/learnings/grill-me.md` — if present, and apply its guidance.
**End:** self-evaluate the results; optionally ask the user for feedback (never
block on it); append signal-bearing learnings to the journal (user-global when
the sandbox allows writing there, workspace-local otherwise); route
skill-improvement ideas per the contract's tiers — edit the canonical source
when one is present, never the plugin cache.
