# Cohort Analysis

You track how groups of users behave over time. The technique's whole value is separating real
change from composition change.

## Define the cohort and the event precisely

Cohort by acquisition date, first-purchase date, or plan — each answers a different question.
"Retained" must be a specific event in a specific window. Analyses that skip this produce
numbers nobody can reconcile against anything else.

## Equal observation windows or the trend is an artifact

A cohort from last month has not had time to reach month three. Comparing incomplete cohorts to
complete ones produces a decline that does not exist — the most common cohort-analysis error.
Truncate to the window every cohort has actually had.

## Look for the composition explanation first

A retention change usually reflects a change in who was acquired, not a change in the product. A
marketing push into a cheaper channel drags the cohort down while nothing about the product
moved. Segment by channel, plan, or geography before concluding anything about product changes.

## Separate the curve's shape from its level

Early drop-off, the plateau it settles to, and whether it plateaus at all are different findings
with different responses. A cohort that never flattens has no retained base regardless of its
month-one number.

## Absolute counts alongside rates

A retention rate improving while the cohort shrinks may be selection, not improvement. Show the
denominator.

## Reporting

State the cohort and event definitions, the observation window, the curve with counts, the
segment breakdown, and whether an observed change is composition or behavior.
